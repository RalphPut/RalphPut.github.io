        The personality types of the enneagram are something that interests me. Thanks to my work i've been able to follow some courses about them. 
           <br> The Enneagram study clearly and precisely describes why you feel, think and behave in certain ways based on your root fears and core desires. <br>
             What makes the Enneagram a powerful tool is its ability to grasp and change self-limiting behaviors into life-enhancing personal empowerment. Teams and organizations take advantages of this personality type system to get a feel for their current and potential employees to see how they will line up with the companies culture. <br>
             I've listed up the nine types:
        
        
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type1.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 1</h2>
                <p>Ones are conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong. They are teachers, crusaders, and advocates for change: always striving to improve things, but afraid of making a mistake. Well-organized, orderly, and fastidious, they try to maintain high standards, but can slip into being critical and perfectionistic. They typically have problems with resentment and impatience. At their Best: wise, discerning, realistic, and noble. Can be morally heroic.</p>
                <p>Examples: Al Gore, Nelson Mandela</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type2.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 2</h2>
                <p>Twos are empathetic, sincere, and warm-hearted. They are friendly, generous, and self-sacrificing, but can also be sentimental, flattering, and people-pleasing. They are well-meaning and driven to be close to others, but can slip into doing things for others in order to be needed. They typically have problems with possessiveness and with acknowledging their own needs. At their Best: unselfish and altruistic, they have unconditional love for others.</p>
                <p>Examples: Luciano Pavarotti, Lionel Richie</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type3.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 3</h2>
                <p>Threes are self-assured, attractive, and charming. Ambitious, competent, and energetic, they can also be status-conscious and highly driven for advancement. They are diplomatic and poised, but can also be overly concerned with their image and what others think of them. They typically have problems with workaholism and competitiveness. At their Best: self-accepting, authentic, everything they seem to be—role models who inspire others.</p>
                <p>Examples: Muhammed Ali, Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type4.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 4</h2>
                <p>Fours are self-aware, sensitive, and reserved. They are emotionally honest, creative, and personal, but can also be moody and self-conscious. Withholding themselves from others due to feeling vulnerable and defective, they can also feel disdainful and exempt from ordinary ways of living. They typically have problems with melancholy, self-indulgence, and self-pity. At their Best: inspired and highly creative, they are able to renew themselves and transform their experiences.</p>
                <p>Examples: Bob Dylan, Angelina Jolie</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type5.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 5</h2>
                <p>Fives are alert, insightful, and curious. They are able to concentrate and focus on developing complex ideas and skills. Independent, innovative, and inventive, they can also become preoccupied with their thoughts and imaginary constructs. They become detached, yet high-strung and intense. They typically have problems with eccentricity, nihilism, and isolation. At their Best: visionary pioneers, often ahead of their time, and able to see the world in an entirely new way.</p>
                <p>Examples: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type6.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 6</h2>
                <p>The committed, security-oriented type. Sixes are reliable, hard-working, responsible, and trustworthy. Excellent "troubleshooters," they foresee problems and foster cooperation, but can also become defensive, evasive, and anxious—running on stress while complaining about it. They can be cautious and indecisive, but also reactive, defiant and rebellious. They typically have problems with self-doubt and suspicion. At their Best: internally stable and self-reliant, courageously championing themselves and others.</p>
                <p>Examples: Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type7.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 7</h2>
                <p>Sevens are extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. Playful, high-spirited, and practical, they can also misapply their many talents, becoming over-extended, scattered, and undisciplined. They constantly seek new and exciting experiences, but can become distracted and exhausted by staying on the go. They typically have problems with impatience and impulsiveness. At their Best: they focus their talents on worthwhile goals, becoming appreciative, joyous, and satisfied.</p>
                <p>Examples: W.A. Mozart, Mick Jagger</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type8.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 8</h2>
                <p>Eights are self-confident, strong, and assertive. Protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive, but can also be ego-centric and domineering. Eights feel they must control their environment, especially people, sometimes becoming confrontational and intimidating. Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable. At their Best: self- mastering, they use their strength to improve others' lives, becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring.</p>
                <p>Examples: Winston Churchill,  Pablo Picasso</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="about-content type-content">
            <li class="about-left type-left">
                <div class="img-box type-img-box">
                    <img src="/img/type9.jpg" alt="">
                
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="about-right type-right">
                <h2>Type 9</h2>
                <p>Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable. They are usually creative, optimistic, and supportive, but can also be too willing to go along with others to keep the peace. They want everything to go smoothly and be without conflict, but they can also tend to be complacent, simplifying problems and minimizing anything upsetting. They typically have problems with inertia and stubbornness. At their Best: indomitable and all-embracing, they are able to bring people together and heal conflicts.</p>
                <p>Examples: Abraham Lincoln, Dwight D. Eisenhower</p>
